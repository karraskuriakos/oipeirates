== Long Description ==

jQuery is the most popular javascript helper library on the planet. WordPress relies on jQuery, and many, many plugins and themes do, too. WPtouch also leverages jQuery and can optimize your website's loading speed by choosing a newer version (2.x), or loading jQuery (and all other scripts that depend on it) in your theme's footer, increasing page speed load times.
